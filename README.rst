:current status: This is a work in progress. Currently gets all links from however many pages of craigslist(up to 2500 listings), puts unique entries into dictionary with prices. Next I will implement price averages and find outliers. 

This branch (newapproach) will attempt to open urls of all vehicle listings. It is slower, but will reveal better formatted information and nicer, more thorough output.
