:current status: This is a work in progress. Currently will pull from vehicle sales on Craigslist and return Year, Make, Model, price. Relies on well formatted craigslist posts.

This branch (newapproach) will attempt to open urls of all vehicle listings. It is slower, but will reveal better formatted information and nicer, more thorough output.
